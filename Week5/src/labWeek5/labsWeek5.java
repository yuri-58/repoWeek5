		// This Lab will give you a basic look at creating an Object Oriented Card Game.  
		//		The idea here is to prepare you for your Week 6 Unit Final Project.
		//		There are many ways to implement this Lab, please use the tools that you know,
		//		and go from there.
		// These exercises are intended to be coded in order 1 through 5.

			// A standard deck of playing cards has 52 cards as specified below 
			//		i. There are 4 suits:  Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, & Spades
			//				
			//	   ii. Each suit has 13 cards:  Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, 
			//									 Eight, Nine, Ten, Jack, Queen, King & Ace
			//
			//	  iii. Comparing Cards:  When comparing two cards, Ace is high and Two is low.
			//							 to make this easy, a Two will have a value of 2, a
			//							 Three will have a value of 3, ... and an Ace will have
			//							 a value of 14.
			//
		
			
			// 1. Card Class:
			//		Create a class called Card to represent a standard playing card. 
			//		Fields:   The Card class should have the following fields:
			// 			a. name field
			//			b. suit field
			//			c. value field for comparing against other cards.
			//
			//		Methods:  This class can have any useful method.
			//			a. describe() to display the card information to the Console.
			//			b. Getters & Setters 
			//
			System.out.println("\nQuestion 1: Card Class");
			// Add your code here to instantiate a Card
			cards52 alpha = new cards52();
			
			System.out.println(alpha.randomCard());
			
			// Call the describe method on the newly instantiated card.
			
			
			
			

			// 2. Deck Class:
			//		Create a class called Deck.
			//		Fields:  This class should have a list of Card field called cards 
			//				 that will hold all the cards in the deck. 
			//			List<Card> cards = new ArrayList<Card>(); 
			//
			//		Constructor: The constructor for the Deck Class should
			// 			instantiate all 52 standard playing cards and add them to the cards list.
			//
			//		Methods:  
			//			a.  describe() to describe the deck to the Console -- 
			//					print out all of the cards in the deck.
			//
			System.out.println("\nQuestion 2: Deck Class");
		    // Add your code here to instantiate a Deck	
			Deck beta = new Deck();
			
			System.out.println(beta.deckOfCards());
		    
		    // Call the describe method on the newly instantiated deck.
		    
		    
		    
		    
			
			
			// 3. Deck shuffle() Method:
			//		Add a shuffle method within the Deck Class
			System.out.println("\nQuestion 3: Deck shuffle() method");
			// Test your method here
			
			System.out.println(beta.shuffleDeck());
			
			
			// Call the describe method on the newly shuffled deck.

			
			
			
			// 4. Deck draw() Method:
			//		Add a draw method within the Deck Class
			System.out.println("\nQuestion 4: Deck draw() method");
			// Test your method here
			System.out.println(beta.drawDeck());
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			// 5. Create Game Board:
			//		Create and test a method that takes an int as a parameter (representing the
			// 			number of players for a game) and returns a Map<String, List<Card>>
			// 			that represents each player (i.e. "Player 1", "Player 2", etc..) 
			//			and their cards.
			//
			// 			The method should create a new instance of Deck, shuffle it,
			// 			and deal the cards out to the "players" in the Map.
			System.out.println("\nQuestion 5: Create Game");
			// Call your method here
			beta.dealDeck(5);
